                            translating psychological theories into real-world impact. With a strong focus on
                            Counselling Psychology and Research, I specialize in mental health diagnostics, using a

                            My expertise spans the physiological, emotional, and social factors that shape human
                            behavior, grounded in Clinical Psychology and Research Methodology. I am deeply committed to
                            advancing mental health awareness, developing innovative therapeutic approaches and
                            fostering positive change through empathy and evidence-based practices.

                            Let’s connect and explore how we can contribute to the evolving landscape of psychology,
                            turning insights into meaningful progress.
